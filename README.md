Nexus example playbook
======================

This playbook utilizes the original
[ansible-nexus3-oss](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/ansible-nexus3-oss) by [samherve](https://github.com/samherve) which we will mostdefintelly contribute back once we complete.

What [Dan Hirsch](https://github.com/hackndoes) did in the dev branch fork
is add support for docker hosted, virtual & proxy repos, there is still
some work ... [ configuring docker privilidges, configure apache or and nginx to proxy docker registry and more ]


## QuickStart

```
git clone git@github.com:shelleg/ansible-playbook-nexus3.git
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
Vagrant up
```

username: admin
